      ROUTINE(S): 

	Modified routines:
		nsvb.f
		r8vol2.f
		r2oldv.f
		blmvol.f
		profile.f
		profile2.f
		r10vol1.f
		numlog.f
		
	New routines:
		
            
     MAIN TOPIC: 
	(1) Modified nsvb.f to add default DECAYCD = 3 for dead trees and made correction in NVB_BrchRem subroutine
	(2) checked max number logs (20) for profile model to avoid program crash

     RESULT/IMPACT: 
        (1) NSVB equation for dead tree without DECAYCD
	(2) Tree with more than 20 logs will return error and no volume calculation.
